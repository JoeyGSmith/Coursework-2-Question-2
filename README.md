# Coursework 2 Question 2
The AbstractQuadratureRule files contain a class that is derived from in the other files, with pure virtual functions for integrating the function, as well as fL_i and L_iL_j, where the L_i are the Lagrange polynomials of the array of points x_i.
The Gauss4Point and Simpson files are class derived from AbstractQuadratureRule, and apply the pure virtual functions from AbstractQuadratureRule, using the Gaussian 4 point and Simpson's rules, respectively.
The Matrix and Vector files are NOT mine, but are used in the other files to perform matrix and vector algebra.
